What do you wish you had done differently in your design/implementation?

    Our customers did not ask us to change anything about our design/ implementation, so I'm not
    sure that we would change much about our design. While designing our code, we were very
    conscious of using interfaces rather than concrete classes as return types and parameters so
    that our code could be more flexible as well as making sure our components are not coupled.


Did you learn any lessons from the code given to you, or the updates you had to make for your
customers?

    Our customers didn't ask that any changes be made to our code. Still, through this experience
    we both came to truly understand the consequences of some designs and thus why they are
    considered "bad design". We especially came to appreciate code that closely reflects reality
    rather than what may be more convenient for the programmers.

What was your experience like with your providers?

    Our providers were really nice. We reached out to them a couple of times to ask for questions
    or their thinking, and they always responded quickly and politely. They were approachable
    and extremely helpful in their responses.
